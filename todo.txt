# Ringdown Improvement Backlog (reviewed October 10, 2025)

- [ ] Harden configuration loading around `RINGDOWN_CONFIG_PATH`. `app/config_schema.py` and `app/settings.py` still fall back to `config.example.yaml` without an opt-in toggle; add an env guard and regression tests to keep behaviour safe for pytest runs.
- [ ] Enhance inline guidance inside `secret-manager.yaml` (we are keeping a single canonical file) so developers understand how to bind env vars to mounted secrets.
- [ ] Deployment sanity checklist. No automated or documented checklist covers `pytest`, `/twiml` fetch, and a simulated WebSocket run; codify this workflow before the next release.
- [ ] Release-ready commit curation. After the 0.2.0 merge, confirm whether additional rebasing or grouping is required ahead of the next review cycle.
